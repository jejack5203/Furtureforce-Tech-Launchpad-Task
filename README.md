### Reflection Questions 

1. If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the userâ€™s experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?

If I had more time, I would expand the contact section of my website. Ideally, I would create a link to a separate form of questions the user can answer. This will help narrow the type of feedback I receive on issues in education. I would also add a feature that allows users to see other responses. I believe this addition to the website would make it easier for users to engage with the contact section because there is a guide to follow and specific questions to answer, rather than giving broad suggestions. Also, seeing other responses can allow the users to build upon an idea. The challenges I anticipate facing are ensuring the previous responses are saved when new responses are submitted and also being able to navigate back easily to the website homepage once a response is submitted. 

2. Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?

I believe web accessibility is important because it connects people in return for quick and efficient services and useful information. For example, I aim to create a mobile application that is pupil-friendly. I would like to connect primary school students with resources to encourage them to focus on their career development and desires outside of the standard K-12 education curriculum. I choose to include a feature such as a contact section to write feedback on issues in Education because it allows the users to openly provide their personal experiences and concerns. This is in hopes of their specific issue being resolved or taken into consideration. I think it is important that people have a common outlet to express their views and feel heard by others, regardless of their circumstances(s), which can only be achieved through accessible websites.
